# Stopwatch Application

## Overview
This project is a **Stopwatch** created using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It allows users to easily start, stop, and reset a stopwatch. The time is displayed in seconds and milliseconds for a smooth experience.

## Features
- **Start**: Starts the stopwatch and begins counting time.
- **Stop**: Pauses the stopwatch at the current time.
- **Reset**: Resets the stopwatch back to zero.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the structure of the stopwatch and the page.
- **CSS**: To style the page and make the stopwatch visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For the core functionality of the stopwatch (time tracking, start/stop/reset logic).

## How It Works
1. **Start**: Clicking the "Start" button begins the stopwatch and starts counting in seconds and milliseconds.
2. **Stop**: Clicking the "Stop" button pauses the stopwatch at its current value.
3. **Reset**: Clicking the "Reset" button resets the stopwatch to 0 and stops any ongoing time.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the stopwatch.

## Usage
- Click the **Start** button to start the stopwatch.
- Click the **Stop** button to stop the stopwatch.
- Click the **Reset** button to reset the stopwatch to 0.


## License
This project is open-source and available under the **MIT License**.

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by various JavaScript tutorials and guides that demonstrate building simple interactive applications.


This README note provides a clear overview of the project, the features, and how users can interact with your stopwatch. It also includes a basic example of the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make it easy for others to understand and use your project!
